    "Elastic Net Regression is a regression technique that combines the Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) and Ridge regression techniques. It is used for linear and logistic regression problems in which there are many independent variables with potentially high levels of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In traditional linear regression, the objective is to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values. However, when there are many independent variables with high levels of multicollinearity, the traditional regression may result in overfitting or underfitting. This is where Elastic Net Regression comes into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression combines the L1 and L2 regularization techniques of Lasso and Ridge regression, respectively, to address the limitations of traditional regression. The L1 regularization encourages sparse coefficient estimates, which means it can select the most relevant features and remove the irrelevant ones by setting their coefficients to zero. The L2 regularization, on the other hand, reduces the magnitude of the coefficients to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression differs from other regression techniques such as Lasso and Ridge regression by allowing for a balance between the two regularization techniques. This balance is controlled by the hyperparameter alpha, which determines the extent to which the model uses the L1 and L2 regularization techniques. When alpha is set to 0, the model is equivalent to Ridge regression, and when alpha is set to 1, it is equivalent to Lasso regression."

This approach can be especially useful when the missing values are related to the other variables.\n",
